# Estimation Builder

The Estimation Builder module is designed to streamline the process of creating accurate project estimates and quotations. It bridges the gap between requirements gathering and project execution by providing tools to calculate effort, time, and cost.

## Feature List

| Feature Name | Description | Priority | User Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Generate Estimation** | A "Generate estimation with AI" button that automatically creates a project estimate based on the data collected in the Requirements Gathering phase. The AI analyzes requirements to produce an **itemized breakdown** of tasks, estimated **hours**, **total** effort, and cost calculations based on a **hypothetical hourly rate**. | **High** | Drastically reduces the time spent on initial scoping and provides a baseline for further refinement. |
| **Manual Line Item Entry** | Interface to manually add, edit, or remove estimation line items. Users can specify task descriptions, assign roles, and input hours/days. | **High** | Allows for precise control and adjustment of the estimate to account for specific project nuances. |
| **Role-Based Rate Cards** | Configuration of hourly or daily rates for different team roles (e.g., Senior Developer, UI Designer, Project Manager). | **Medium** | Ensures financial accuracy by applying the correct cost structure to different types of work. |
| **Estimation Templates** | Pre-built templates for common project types (e.g., E-commerce, MVP, Landing Page) with standard line items pre-populated. | **Medium** | Standardizes the estimation process and speeds up the creation of quotes for similar projects. |
| **Export to PDF/Proposal** | Functionality to generate a professional PDF proposal or quotation document from the estimation data, ready to be sent to the client. | **Medium** | Provides a polished, client-facing deliverable without needing external document tools. |
| **Revision History** | Tracks changes made to the estimate over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions or compare different scope options. | **Low** | distinct versions help in negotiating scope and cost with the client without losing original data. |
