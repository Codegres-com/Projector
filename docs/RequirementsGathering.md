# Requirements Gathering Modules

This document outlines the various methods and features for gathering client requirements within the **Pre-Project: Estimation & Quotation** phase. These features aim to capture project scope accurately from the start.

## Feature List

| Feature Name | Description | Priority | User Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Text-based Requirement Entry** | A rich text editor allowing clients or Project Managers to manually input detailed requirement descriptions, user stories, and acceptance criteria. Includes support for lists, headers, and basic formatting. | **High** | Provides a standard, flexible way to document requirements immediately without needing external files. Essential for MVP. |
| **PDF/Document Upload** | Ability to upload existing requirement documents (PDF, DOCX). The system should store these files and, in future iterations, parse text from them for analysis. | **High** | Allows clients to provide pre-existing documentation, reducing friction during the initial engagement. |
| **Structured Forms / Wizard** | A step-by-step wizard or questionnaire (e.g., "What is your target platform?", "Do you need user authentication?"). Configurable templates for different project types. | **Medium** | Ensures critical information isn't missed and standardizes input for easier estimation. |
| **External Import (Email/CSV)** | Tools to import requirements from CSV files or directly convert email threads into requirement items. | **Medium** | Streamlines the workflow for agencies that receive requirements via email or maintain them in spreadsheets. |
| **Voice/Audio Notes** | Record verbal requirements during meetings or allow clients to leave audio notes. Includes a placeholder for future transcription services. | **Low** | Captures ad-hoc ideas and meeting details that might be lost in text notes; useful for mobile users. |
| **Visual Annotation & Whiteboarding** | An interactive canvas to sketch ideas, upload mockups, and annotate images to visually describe UI/UX requirements. | **Low** | Clarifies design intent and layout requirements that are difficult to express in words. |
